Election results come from the <a href="https://www.ok.gov/elections/Election_Info/Election_Results/2018-Election_Results.html">Oklahoma State Election Board</a>. 2010 Decennial Census demographic data were downloaded from the <a href="https://api.census.gov/data/2010/dec/sf1">Census API</a>. The 2010 census block shapefile as well as congressional and state legislative districts for Oklahoma were downloaded from the US Census Bureau’s <a href="https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html">TIGER/Line Shapefiles</a>.

Oklahoma reports absentee and early votes at the precinct level for every county except for Oklahoma County and Tulsa County, where non-election day votes are reported for the whole county. For those two counties, absentee and early votes were disaggregated to the precinct level by population. Demographic data were aggregated from the block level and precincts were assigned to congressional and state legislative districts using <a href="https://github.com/mggg/maup">MGGG’s proration software</a>. Precincts for Pushmataha County were digitized to conform to a map provided by the county.
