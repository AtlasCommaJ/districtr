<p>These maps were created as part of <a href="https://mggg.org">MGGG</a>'s <a href="https://mggg.org/Chicago.pdf">Study of Reform Proposals for Chicago City Council</a>. We set out to explore how different districts, or moving to multi-member districts, might impact representation and better promote a fair and responsive city government.  The report considered the following reform methods: 
<ul>
    <li>Redrawing the lines in the current 50-ward system</li>
    <li>Shrinking the city council from 50 members to 30 or fewer</li>
    <li>Moving from single-member districts to multi-member districts</li>
    <li>Moving from plurality elections to ranked choice voting</li>
</ul>
