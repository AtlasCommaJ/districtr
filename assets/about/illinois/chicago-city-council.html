<p>The City of Chicago is divided into 50 districts, known as wards, for the City Council. The Chicago City Council is represented by 50 elected officials, known as aldermen. Each alderman is elected by and represents a single ward.</p>
<p>The current ward plan in Chicago is widely criticized for being gerrymandered. Some argue that the 50-member city council is inefficiently large. Today, the demographic makeup of Chicago is split roughly in thirds between Hispanic, Black, and White racial/ethnic groups. Black populations are the most densely clustered in the city, but the Black percentage as a total share of the population has been decreasing in recent decades.  Due to the high levels of segregation in the city, the current wards tend to be dominated by one racial/ethnic group with an alderman nearly always coming from that dominant group. Latinos are the most underrepresented group, with only 22% representation in the city council despite making up 29% of the population.</p>
