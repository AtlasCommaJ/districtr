<p>The Maryland precinct shapefile was obtained from the <a href="https://planning.maryland.gov/Redistricting/Pages/2010/precinct.aspx">Maryland Department of Planning's Redistricting website</a> and processed by members of the MGGG Redistricting Lab. Election data come from the <a href="https://elections.maryland.gov/elections/2018/election_data/index.html">Maryland State Board of Elections</a>. It is important to note that Maryland only releases election day ballots cast at the precinct level and the election results here do not include early, absentee or provisional votes.  More information about our data sources and processing can be found <a href="https://github.com/mggg-states/MD-shapefiles">here</a>.</p>
