<p>
    The units used here are <strong>precincts</strong>. The raw, unprocessed
    VTDs were collected from the Census
    <a href="https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html"
        >TIGER/Line Shapefiles</a
    >. The precinct and congressional district shapefiles come from the Michigan
    Department of State through the [State of Michigan GIS Open Data
    Portal](http://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/2016-voting-precincts).
    Demographic data at the block level are from [IPUMS
    NHGIS](https://www.nhgis.org/). Shapefiles for Michigan's state house and
    senate districts were downloaded from the US Census Bureau's [TIGER/Line
    Program](https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php). Precinct
    level election data for 2016 were obtained from the [MIT Elections Data and
    Science Lab](https://electionlab.mit.edu/). The source shapefile for this
    module, along with additional information about processing, is available for
    download from MGGG's GitHub organization
    <a href="https://github.com/mggg-states/MI-shapefiles">@mggg-states</a>.
