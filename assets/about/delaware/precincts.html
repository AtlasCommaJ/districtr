<p>The Delaware election district (precinct) shapefile was obtained from <a href="http://opendata.firstmap.delaware.gov/datasets/delaware-election-boundaries">Delaware FirstMap Data</a>, a GIS service of the State of Delaware. Election data come from the <a href="https://elections.delaware.gov/index.shtml">Delaware Department of Elections</a>. 2010 Decennial Census demographic data were downloaded from the <a href="https://api.census.gov/data/2010/dec/sf1">Census API</a>. The 2010 census block shapefile for Delaware was downloaded from the US Census Bureau’s <a href="https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html">TIGER/Line Shapefiles</a>.</p>
<p>Some very limited merging of precincts in the tabular election data was necessary to join to the precinct shapefile. Data from three countywide precincts that reported absentee votes were disaggregated by voting age population using MGGG’s proration software. Demographic data was aggregated from the block level using MGGG’s proration software. State legislative district IDs were also assigned to precincts using this package.</p>
