<p>In 2019, all eyes are on Lowell, Massachusetts. The City of Lowellâ€™s at-large electoral system has been challenged in a recent lawsuit (Huot et al. v. City of Lowell et al). Plaintiffs in the case argued that the current system dilutes the votes of Lowell's communities of color for the City Council and School Board. For more information about the lawsuit, read LCR's explainer <a href="https://www.lawyerscom.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Lowell-Voting-Rights-Lawsuit-FAQ-Final.pdf">[here]</a>.</p>
<p>  This November, Lowell residents will have a chance to vote on a new system! The choices for City Council are (a) a city-wide system electing 9 council members by ranked choice, or (b) 8 districts plus 3 at-large seats, raising the size of the council to 11 members.</p>
