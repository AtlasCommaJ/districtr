    There are two vintages of precincts in these maps, one from the 2000 redistricting cycle and another from the 2010 redistricting cycle.  The 2002-2010 raw, unprocessed shapefile comes <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/tiger-line-shapefile-2012-2010-state-massachusetts-2010-census-voting-district-state-based-vtd">from the United States Census Bureau</a> and was sent to MGGG by Secretary of the Commonwealth Francis Galvin's office.  The 2012-2016 raw, unprocessed precinct shapefile comes from the office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, William Francis Galvin.  All election data comes from the Secretary of the Commonwealth's <a href="http://electionstats.state.ma.us">Elections Division website</a>.  The source precinct shapefiles, along with additional information about processing, are available for download from MGGG's GitHub organization <a href="https://github.com/mggg-states/MA-shapefiles">@mggg-states</a>.
