<p>The statewide maps were created to aid in a paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09051"> "Locating the representational baseline: Republicans in Massachusetts,"</a> written by MGGG and collaborators. Despite Republicans usually gaining between 30% and 40% of the two-way vote share in statewide elections, Massachusetts has not elected a Republican to the US House of Representatives since 1994. The paper finds that the underperformance of Republicans in Massachusetts is not the result of gerrymandering or candidate availability, but rather is a factor of the spatial distribution of Republican voters in the state.</p>
