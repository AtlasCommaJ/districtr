<p>A combination of federal, state, and local rules, or criteria, guide the redistricting process. While the federal requirements apply universally, each state and local government can establish their own subset of additional criteria. In this section, we’ll highlight the federally-required and common criteria. For more information about your state, visit our collaborator, Justin Levitt’s <a href="https://redistricting.lls.edu">website</a>.</p>

<h3>Required Criteria</h3>

<p><b>Achieve equal population.</b> Each district must have the same total population to ensure that every person has fair representation.</p>
<p><b>Comply with the Voting Rights Act (VRA).</b> Passed in 1965, the VRA prohibits systemic and discriminatory practices that dilute the vote of people of color.  A district map violates the VRA, if the map systemically prevents a minority group from electing their candidate of choice.</p>


<h3>Common Criteria</h3>

<p><b>Preserve Communities of Interest (COIs). </b>  Districts should avoid splitting COIs. A COI is a community, neighborhood, or group of people who have common policy concerns and would benefit from being represented together. This rule, if required in your state, is an important tool that communities can leverage to remain in one district. (Draw your community in Districtr!)</p>
<p><b>Be Contiguous.</b> Districts should be one continuous shape, rather than broken into multiple pieces.</p>
<p><b>Be Compact.</b> Districts should be densely packed together, rather than sprawling and irregular shapes.</p>
<p><b>Follow Political and Natural Boundaries.</b> To the extent practicable, districts should avoid splitting cities, towns, and counties and crossing intuitive boundaries, such as rivers, mountains, highways, etc.</p>
<p><b>Respect Existing Legislative Boundaries and Incumbency. </b> To the extent practicable, districts should follow existing legislative boundaries and avoid cutting incumbent representatives out of their district.</p>
