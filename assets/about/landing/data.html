  In our map, you draw your own districts and communities out of units or building blocks.  Common building blocks that youâ€™ll see in our modules are <b>precincts</b>, <b>block groups</b>, or <b>blocks</b>.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Precincts</b> are the smallest unit at which votes are counted. Everyone registered to vote gets assigned to a precinct, and then these votes are reported for the area of the entire precinct. Therefore, precincts are the smallest unit on which you can see election results. If you open a map with precincts for building blocks, you can explore historical election results and partisan lean in your state. Precinct level data can be notoriously difficult to collect -- see our <a href="">explainer</a> <!-- [Moon PDF] -->for more information on this process.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Block groups</b> and <b>blocks</b> are areas developed by the Census Bureau. Blocks groups can display demographic data from the Decennial Census, as well as American Community Survey (ACS) data, such as income, homeownership, and broadband access. Blocks, the smallest unit of reporting for the Census Bureau, nest inside of block groups. They only display demographic data from the Decennial Census -- population counts, race, and ethnicity. We determine the best data for each map on a state-by-state basis. Districtr does not disaggregate information from block groups to blocks. If only block group-level data are available, we only show information at that scale.
