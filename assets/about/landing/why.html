    <b>Redistricting</b> is a long and consequential process that starts every ten years after the Census data is released. Where and how the lines are drawn influences everything from who can get elected to how federal, state, and local resources get allocated.

<p>
    And <b>communities matter</b>. The process is different in every state—some states collect public maps and communities of interest (COIs). Community members can participate in the redistricting process by submitting public testimony. Our <a href="">COI explainer</a><!-- [link to Liz/interface video] --> talks more about this.

<h3>2020 Census and Redistricting</h3>
<p>
    This year the new decennial census is being conducted this year.  In many states the number of congressional seats they have will change as we account for national population shifts.  If you see two options for drawing congressional seats, it's because your state is projected to be affected by reapportionment.  In Spring 2021, the new Census data will be sent to the states, and they will all re-draw their lines to re-balance district populations according to the population shifts of the last decade.
