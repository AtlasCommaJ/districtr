    <b>Redistricting</b> is dividing up a jurisdiction (like a state, county, or city) into districts for the purpose of electing representatives. Where and how the lines are drawn influences everything from who is likely to be elected to how resources get allocated. And when it comes to democratic representation, <b>communities matter</b>. If your community is split up into different small pieces every ten years, it makes it harder to have a voice in government.

<p>
    The official line-drawing process is different in every state, and in 2021 a record number of states will ask the public for input. Districtr is a tool to help you try your hand at identifying your community or drawing your own districts. Speak up for your community – and show the line-drawers how you want to be represented!

    And <b>communities matter</b>. The process is different in every state—some states collect public maps and communities of interest (COIs). Community members can participate in the redistricting process by submitting public testimony. Our <a href="">COI explainer</a>[link to Liz/interface video] talks more about this.

<h3>2020 Census and Redistricting</h3>
<p>
    This year the new decennial census is being conducted this year.  In many states the number of congressional seats they have will change as we account for national population shifts.  If you see two options for drawing congressional seats, it's because your state is projected to be affected by reapportionment.  In Spring 2021, the new Census data will be sent to the states, and they will all re-draw their lines to re-balance district populations according to the population shifts of the last decade.
