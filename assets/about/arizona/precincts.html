<p>Where you will find precincts: Statewide maps</p>
<p>The precinct shapefile is made available on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/azsecretaryofstate/arizona-statewide-precinct-shapefile?select=az_vtd_2018_new_pima.shp">Kaggle</a> by Garret Archer, formerly Senior Elections Analyst with the Arizona Secratary of State and currently a Data Analyst with ABC15 Arizona. Tabular election data are from the <a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/">MIT Election Data Science Lab</a>. Block level demographic data for the 2010 Decennial Census were retrieved using the <a href="https://api.census.gov/data/2010/dec/sf1">Census API</a>. Processing was completed by members of the Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group (MGGG).</p>
<p>Some very limited merging of precincts in the original shapefile was necessary to join election results. La Paz County precincts were edited to match data provided on the county's <a href="http://www.co.la-paz.az.us/DocumentCenter/View/76/Precinct-Map-PDF">election website</a>.</p>

  Native American Tribes and Nations come from the US Census's American Indian Areas shapefile.
