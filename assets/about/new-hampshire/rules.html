New Hampshire’s legislature is called the <strong>General Court</strong>, and is composed of a
24-member state Senate and a 400-member state House, by far the largest state legislative body in the nation.
The House is elected from a complicated combination of standard and “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floterial_district">floterial</a>” districts,
and would be difficult to represent in a Districtr module.

<p>There are various reform ideas circulating to bring the NH House more in line with common legislative districting practices.</p>
