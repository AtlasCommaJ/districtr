<p>These maps were created as part of the research process for MGGG's paper on Alaska, 
<a href="https://mggg.org/alaska">Mathematics of Nested Districts: The Case of Alaska</a>.  
The report investigates the possibility of a gerrymander that pairs nested House districts 
for Senate districts to favor Republicans, since Democrats control the House but the Senate 
has a â…” Republican majority. It was ultimately determined that there was a Republican skew 
in the enacted plans for the Senate when compared to all the possible plans that would fit
the necessary criteria. This partisan sway is equivalent to that of a plan made from scratch. 
Choices in how to determine contiguity rules when it comes to bodies of water and how to 
distribute the high number of unprecincted votes can have significant sway on partisan results as well. </p>
