    The units used here are <strong>precincts</strong>. The Minnesota precinct shapefiles with election results were created by the <a href="https://www.sos.state.mn.us/elections-voting/">Minnesota Secretary of State Election Division</a> and obtained from the <a href="https://www.gis.leg.mn/html/download.html">Minnesota LCC-GIS</a>. 2010 Decennial Census demographic data were downloaded from the <a href="https://api.census.gov/data/2010/dec/sf1">Census API</a>. The 2010 census block shapefile for Minnesota was downloaded from the US Census Bureauâ€™s <a href="https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html">TIGER/Line Shapefiles</a>.
    The source shapefile for this module, along with additional information
    about processing, is available for download from MGGG's GitHub organization
