<p>The Maine precinct shapefile was obtained from the <a href="https://www.maine.gov/geolib/catalog.html">Maine Geolibrary</a> and processed by members of the MGGG Redistricting Lab (MGGG). Election data come from the <a href="https://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/results/index.html">Maine Bureau of Corporations, Elections, & Commissions</a>. Data from absentee votes reported at the state level were disaggregated by voting age population. Because of data reporting and processing, a few precincts cross county boundaries.  Demographic data for the 2010 Decennial Census were retrieved using the <a href="https://api.census.gov/data/2010/dec/sf1">Census API</a>.  More information about our data sources and processing can be found <a href="https://github.com/mggg-states/ME-shapefiles">here</a>.</p>
