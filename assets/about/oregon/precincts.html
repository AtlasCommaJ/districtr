    This shapefile was compiled by Kevin Rancik with the help of Steve Gerontakis and was used by The Oregonian. It was processed and verified by members of the MGGG Redistricting Lab.  Election results for 2016 and 2018 were cleaned by MGGG Redistricting Lab staff and joined to the geographic data along with demographic data from the 2010 Decennial Census.
