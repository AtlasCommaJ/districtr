<p>Where you will find precincts: Statewide and Portland maps</p>
<p>This shapefile was compiled by Kevin Rancik with the help of Steve Gerontakis and was used by The Oregonian. It was processed and verified by members of the Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group.  Election results for 2016 and 2018 were cleaned by MGGG staff and joined to the geographic data along with demographic data from the 2010 Decennial Census.
