    The Suffolk County election district shapefile was downloaded from <a href="https://www.muckrock.com/foi/new-york-16/ny-state-election-district-shapefiles-for-past-elections-60752/">Muckrock</a>, where it and the corresponding Freedom of Information Act request to the State of New York are hosted.  Demographic information from the 2010 Decennial Census was downloaded at the block level from the <a href="https://api.census.gov/">Census API</a>.  It was processed by members of the MGGG Redistricting Lab, to trim the shapefile to the town of Islip.
