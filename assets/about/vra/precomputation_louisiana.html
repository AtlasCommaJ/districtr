<h3 class="media__subtitle">VRA Effectiveness</h3>

<p>
    The effectiveness score in this module looks at the preformance of Black candidates of choice
    (estimated using EI at the statewide level) in the drawn districts over historical elections.
    The following precomputed factors are then used to weight those results: the confidence of the
    candiate of choice, whether or not the canidate is a member of the minority group, and the
    recency of the elections.
</p>
<p>
    The table below shows these precomputed factors for the 10 election groups looked at in Louisiana.

<p>
    Success for the Black-preferred candidate is assessed in a district when that candidate either 
    (a) receives a majority in the primary, (b) achieves a plurality in the primary and the 
    Democratic candidate receives the most votes in the paired general, or (c) achieves a plurality
    in the primary but there is no general because of a statewide majority for some 
    (possibly different) candidate.
