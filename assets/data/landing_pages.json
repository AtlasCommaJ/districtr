The report investigates the possibility of a gerrymander that pairs nested House districts for Senate districts to favor Republicans, since Democrats control the House but the Senate has a ⅔ Republican majority. It was ultimately determined that there was a Republican skew in the enacted plans for the Senate when compared to all the possible plans that would fit the necessary criteria. This partisan sway is equivalent to that of a plan made from scratch. Choices in how to determine contiguity rules when it comes to bodies of water and how to distribute the high number of unprecincted votes can have significant sway on partisan results as well. </p>"

Some argue that the 50-member city council is inefficiently large. Due to the high levels of segregation in the city, the current wards tend to be dominated by one racial/ethnic group with an alderman nearly always coming from that dominant group. Latinos are the most underrepresented group, with only 22% representation in the city council despite making up 29% of the population.</p><h3>Community Areas</h3><p>In the 1920s, researchers at the University of Chicago divided the city into 77 community areas that have played an important role in city planning and culture since their inception. The community areas, and the city more generally, are highly segregated. Today, the demographic makeup of Chicago is split roughly in thirds between Hispanic, Black, and White racial/ethnic groups. Black populations are the most densely clustered in the city, but the Black percentage as a total share of the population has been decreasing in recent decades.</p>"

Alcorn</h4><p>This case was filed in 2013 to challenge Virginia’s Third Congressional District as a racial gerrymander. In 2014, a district court ruled in favor of the plaintiff, determining that the district was an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. When this decision was appealed to a higher court, the U.S. Supreme Court vacated and remanded the case back to the district court for reconsideration in 2015. The district court ruled, again, in favor of the plaintiff. After the U.S. Supreme Court found that the case lacked standing to appeal, an outside expert was commissioned to redraw the districts to remedy the gerrymander. A new remedial plan was implemented in 2016.</p><h4>Vesilind v. Va. State Board of Elections</h4><p>This case was filed in 2015 to challenge state General Assembly districts for violating Virginia’s constitutional requirement to draw compact districts. The district court ruled that the districts were constitutionally valid in 2017. When this decision was appealed, the Virginia Supreme Court upheld this ruling.</p><h4>Bethune-Hill v. Virginia Board of Elections</h4><p>This case was filed in 2014 to challenge 12 State House districts as racial gerrymanders. In 2015, a district court ruled that race did not predominate in 11 of the 12 districts, but race was considered when drawing one district (District 75). However, the court determined that considering race in District 75 was not unconstitutional because the parameter used, a 55% Black voting age population, was justified by the VRA due to highly racially polarized voting in the area of concern. When this decision was appealed to a higher court, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the rationale for District 75 but vacated and remanded the case back to the lower court for the remaining 11 districts. In 2018, the district court amended their ruling, determining that the remaining 11 districts were racial gerrymanders, initiating a redistricting process. In early 2019, a new map was approved. The Virginia House of Delegates appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court (Virginia House of Delegates v. Bethune-Hill), but the court found that the state House lacked standing to appeal.</p>"

In it, they argue that the system dilutes the votes of Latinos in Yakima County and is in violation of the Washington Voting Rights Act (WVRA) and the Washington State Constitution.  Read the full letter <a href=\"http://weareoneamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/Yakima-County-notice-letter-1.15.20.pdf\">[here]</a>.</p><p>At first glance, Yakima county seems to already be districted to facilitate minority opportunity to elect candidates of choice. There are three districts; District 1 is mostly White, but District 2 has a slight POC majority, including about 40% Hispanic VAP and an additional 8% Native VAP, while District 3 is 55% Hispanic by VAP.</p><p>This is undercut by an unusual—and very problematic—system of electing County Commissioners. Each district is represented by a Commissioner. The primary election is conducted by a district-wide \"jungle primary,\" in which any number of candidates may run and the top two vote-getters advance to the general election without regard to party affiliation. (In fact, candidates with the \"prefers Republican\" label predominate over all others in Yakima, and this is even true for Hispanic candidates.) But the entire county, and not just the district, then votes to choose a winner between the two finalists. This indicates that the system itself negates any advantage of districting, nullifying the minorities' opportunity to elect.</p><p>Read more about our study of Voting Rights in Yakima and possible remedies in our <a href=\"https://mggg.org/uploads/Yakima.pdf\">report</a>.
