<p>A combination of federal, state, and local rules, or criteria, guide the redistricting process. While the federal requirements apply universally, each state and local government can establish their own subset of additional criteria. In this section, weâ€™ll highlight the federally-required and common criteria. For more information about your state, visit our collaborators who outline <a href="https://redistricting.lls.edu/who-fed10.php">who draws the lines</a> and the <a href="https://redistricting.lls.edu/where.php">criteria</a>.</p>

<h3>Required Criteria</h3>

<p><b>Achieve equal population.</b> Based on the idea of "one person, one vote," each district must have the same total population to ensure that every person has fair representation.</p>
<p><b>Comply with the Voting Rights Act (VRA).</b> Passed in 1965, the VRA prohibits systemic and discriminatory practices that dilute the vote and political power of people of color. During the redistricting process, if a map, by design, systemically prevents a minority group from electing a candidate of choice, it is in violation of the VRA.</p>


<h3>Common Criteria</h3>

<p><b>Preserve Communities of Interest (COIs). </b> A COI is a community, neighborhood, or group of people who have common policy concerns and would benefit from being represented together. This rule, if required in your state, is an important tool that communities can leverage to remain in one district. (Draw your community in Districtr!)</p>
<p><b>Be Contiguous.</b> Contiguity is the idea that districts should be one continuous shape, rather than broken into multiple pieces.</p>
<p><b>Be Compact.</b> Compactness is the idea that the shape is densely packed together, rather than sprawling and irregular.</p>
<p><b>Follow Political and Natural Boundaries.</b> To the extent practicable, avoid splitting cities, towns, and counties and crossing natural boundaries, such as rivers, mountains, highways, etc.</p>
<p><b>Respect Existing Legislative Boundaries and Incumbency. </b> To the extent practicable, following existing legislative boundaries and avoids cutting current representatives out of their district.</p>
