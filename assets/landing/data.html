<p> In our modules, you draw your own districts and communities out of units or building blocks.  Common building blocks that youâ€™ll see in our modules are <b>precincts</b>, <b>block groups</b>, or <b>blocks</b>.</p>
<p><b>Precincts</b>  are administrative districts that determine where you vote. During an election, votes are first counted at the precinct-level and reported upward. Precincts are, therefore, the smallest unit with election results. If you open a module with precincts for building blocks, you can explore historical election results and partisan lean in your state. </p>
<p><b>Block groups</b> are areas developed by the Census Bureau. Blocks groups can display demographic data, as well as American Community Survey data, such as income, homeownership, and broadband access. The exact data provided in each module is determined on a state-by-state basis.</p>
<p><b>Blocks</b> are areas developed by the Census Bureau. These are the smallest units of reporting for the Census Bureau and nest inside block groups. Blocks can display demographic data.</p>
