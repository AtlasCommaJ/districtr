<p> In our modules, you draw your own districts and communities out of units or building blocks.  Common building blocks that youâ€™ll see in our modules are <b>precincts</b>, <b>block groups</b>, or <b>blocks</b>.</p>
<p><b>Precincts</b>  are administrative districts that determine where you vote. During an election, votes are first counted at the precinct-level and reported upward. Precincts are, therefore, the smallest unit with election results. If you open a map with precincts for building blocks, you can explore historical election results and partisan lean in your state. </p>
<p><b>Block groups</b> and <b>blocks</b> are areas developed by the Census Bureau. Blocks groups can display demographic data from the Decennial Census, as well as American Community Survey (ACS) data, such as income, homeownership, and broadband access. Blocks, the smallest unit of reporting for the Census Bureau, nest inside of block groups and only display demographic data from the Decennial Census. We determine the best data for each map on a state-by-state basis.</p>
