                        Districtr came about from a conversation with Lawyers
                        for Civil Rights, the Boston arm of the national
                        Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. LCR was
                        describing their work with community members in Lowell,
                        MA, who were frustrated about not having a voice with
                        the city council. In those conversations, a few places
                        kept coming up.

                        point for the city’s Asian and Latino populations, which
                        felt unsafe at night because the city had not provided
                        lighting in the park.

                        public high school, which serves over 3000 students. The
                        city announced plans to move it from its traditional
                        downtown location, but did not invest in substantial
                        outreach to communities of color about possible new
                        sites.
