    </ul>
    <h3> </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>In some areas, there are options to evaluate the age and household income distribution of the population in each district. Some areas also have the ability to check the contiguity of the districts you have drawn.</li>

<h2 class="place__subheading">Sharing your Map</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Clicking the “Share” button saves the map you created and uploads it to the Districtr database. You do not need to create an account, and only the information in your map is shared.</li>
  <img src="/assets/guide/districting/GIF20.gif" alt="" class="screenshot">
  <li>As long as you are in the same browser session, you can update this original map, leaving the link unchanged. To save changes made to the map, click on the “Update” button (in the same location as the “Share” button once you have shared). You will know when your map is up to date when the button says “Saved.” You can keep repeating this process to edit and re-save your map as long as you are in the same browser session.</li>
  <img src="/assets/guide/districting/GIF22.gif" alt="" class="screenshot">
  <li>Anyone who has the link, including you, can open up the map in their browser and make additional changes to it. These changes can be saved to a new link by clicking “Share” again. When the button says “Saved,” this means all changes are saved to the new link.</li>
  <img src="/assets/guide/districting/GIF21.gif" alt="" class="screenshot">
  <li>Whenever you need a copy of the link, click on the “Saved” button.</li>
  <li>To download your map, choose from the options in the drop-down menu in the upper right corner. For more detail on these, refer to the Import/Export Options page.</li>
  <h4>Event Codes</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>MGGG can help you with map collection by setting up an event code for your organization.</li>
    <li>Once you have an event code, you can tag maps with it. When you click “Share,” “Update,” or “Saved,” enter the event code and click “Tag your map.”</li>
    <li>All maps tagged with an event code will be viewable in a dashboard available to the event organizers.</li>
    <li>Event codes can be used to compile and compare a large quantity of maps for a region. Map collections made through events can in turn be used to influence official map-drawing, for community organizing, for educational purposes, and more.</li>
