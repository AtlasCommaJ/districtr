                    <p>
                        Districtr came about from a conversation with
                        <a href="http://lawyersforcivilrights.org/"
                            >Lawyers for Civil Rights</a

                            >Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law</a
                        >. LCR was describing their work with community members
                        in Lowell, MA, who were frustrated about not having a
                        voice with the city council. In those conversations, a
                        few places kept coming up.

                    <p>
                        Like <mark>Clemente Park</mark>, a much-loved meeting
                        point for the city’s Asian and Latino populations, which
                        felt unsafe at night because the city had not provided
                        lighting in the park.

                    <p>
                        And <mark>Lowell High School</mark>, the city’s only
                        public high school, which serves over 3000 students. The
                        city announced plans to move it from its traditional
                        downtown location, but did not invest in substantial
                        outreach to communities of color about possible new
                        sites.

                        Our idea was to create a mapping tool whose fundamental
                        principle is to
                        <strong>ask the community what matters.</strong>

                        With maps that show relevant landmarks and data, users
                        can try their own hand at drawing meaningful
                        demonstration plans.
