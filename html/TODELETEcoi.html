  <h3>Evaluation</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The evaluation tab allows you to see the racial, voting age population, and partisan balance of the communities you are mapping. Some communities pages have additional data for evaluation, such as household income and age.</li>

    <h3>Population by Race</h3>

    </ul>
    <h3>Voting Age Population by Race</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>As in the previous section, you can compare the percentage of the voting age population by race in each community. Voting Age Population (or VAP) is the group of people who are 18 years or older.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Age Histograms, Household Income, and other data</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>In some areas, there are options to evaluate additional demographic information, such as age and household income, in each community and compared to that of the overall locality. As with the Data Layers tab, this information is from the ACS.</li>

</ul>
<h2 class="place__subheading">Sharing your Map</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Clicking on the “Share” button saves the map you created and uploads it to the Districtr database. You do not need to create an account, and only the information in your map is shared.</li>
  <img src="/assets/guide/coi//COI_GIFS/COI_GIF19.gif" alt="" class="screenshot">
  <li>As long as you are in the same browser session, you can update this original map, leaving the link unchanged. To save changes made to the map, click on the “Update” button (in the same location as the “Share” button once you have shared). You will know when your map is up to date when the button says “Saved.” You can keep repeating this process to edit and re-save your map as long as you are in the same browser session.</li>
  <img src="/assets/guide/coi//COI_GIFS/COI_GIF21.gif" alt="" class="screenshot">
  <li>Anyone who has the link, including you, can open up the map in their browser and make additional changes to it. This edited map doesn’t replace the previous one, but you can save it to a new link by clicking “Share” again.</li>
  <img src="/assets/guide/coi//COI_GIFS/COI_GIF20.gif" alt="" class="screenshot">
  <li>Anyone who has the link, including you, can open up the map in their browser and make additional changes to it. These changes can be saved to a new link by clicking “Share” again. When the button says “Saved,” this means all changes are saved to the new link.</li>
  <img src="/assets/guide/coi//COI_GIFS/COI_GIF21.gif" alt="" class="screenshot">
  <li>Whenever you need a copy of the link, click on the “Saved” button.</li>
  <li>To download your map, choose from the options in the drop-down menu in the upper right corner. For more detail on these, refer to the Import/Export Options page.</li>
  <li>
    <h3>Event Codes</h3>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>MGGG can help you with map collection by setting up an event code for your organization.</li>
    <li>Once you have an event code, you can tag maps with it. When you click “Share,” “Update,” or “Saved,” enter the event code and click “Tag your map.”</li>
    <li>All maps tagged with an event code will be viewable in a dashboard available to the event organizers. Event codes can be used to compile a large quantity of maps for a region, to assess coverage and identify areas needing more community mapping, and to compare maps of specific communities. This can be to influence official map-drawing, for community organizing, for educational purposes, and more.</li>
