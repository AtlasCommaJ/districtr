# Districtr

## Development

After cloning the repository, you can run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
Then, to start the Parcel live development server, run `npm run develop`. If you go
to `http://localhost:1234`, you should see Districtr running. The development server
will recompile the JavaScript bundle as you edit the source files in `/src`. Fun!
