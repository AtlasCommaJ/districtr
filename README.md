# Districtr

## Development

After cloning the repository, you can run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
Then, to start the development server, run `npm run develop`. If you go
to `http://localhost:3000`, you should see Districtr running. The development server
will recompile the app's assets, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS as you edit the source files.

If you're interested in contributing, you will at some point want to consult the
[Mapbox GL JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) and
[lit-html](https://lit-html.polymer-project.org/guide) documentation.

## Testing

To run the unit test suite, run `npm run test`. We use the Mocha test framework and
the Chai assertion library. We need to write more unit tests!
